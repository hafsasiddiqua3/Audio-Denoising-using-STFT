# Audio-Denoising-using-STFT
This Python project aims to enhance audio quality by implementing a denoising algorithm based on the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The Short-Time Fourier Transform allows for a time-frequency representation of the audio signal, enabling effective noise reduction.
